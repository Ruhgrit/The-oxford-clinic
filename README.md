# The-oxford-clinic Providing YOU with the inside info
Virus edition


Today we will be reviewing a very rare virus that is almost never seen! This is of course, listed below.

As a medic who has served for 23 years now turned writer, I can say I have NEVER seen a case of this rare virus.
As I have stated in another article, and I still will, our webspace is mediocre at best, but that is what is needed in order to give you an ad free viewing experence!
Without further adou, I present to you the virus so rare there are only 6 documented cases.

Transmission:

Elanaitism spreads through psychosocial and neurochemical contagion during prolonged emotional or physical interactions. Key transmission mechanisms include:

1. Prolonged Proximity:

The infected person's altered neurons emit imperceptible psychological and neurochemical signals that "reprogram" the brain of susceptible individuals.

This parasitic influence subtly erodes the mental defenses of those nearby.



2. Emotional Drain:

The infected person creates intense emotional dependency, compelling others to remain close and interact, thus feeding the parasitic relationship.

Symptoms:

Stage 1: Subtle Onset

Persistent fatigue and difficulty focusing.

Subconscious feelings of discomfort or unease in the infected person’s presence.

Unexplainable mental fog after interactions.


Stage 2: Parasitic Dependence

The infected individual exhibits increasingly erratic behavior, relying on others for emotional and mental support to sustain their own stability.

Their neurons have undergone a unique rearrangement, allowing them to siphon mental energy from others, which is crucial to maintaining their cognitive function.

The infected person may feel an overwhelming need to keep others emotionally engaged, drawing them further into the parasitic relationship.

Characteristics of the Infected Person:

They may display periods of heightened emotional instability, aggression, or emotional manipulation, all driven by their need to "feed" on the mental energy of others.

The infected individual becomes more dependent as the illness progresses, unable to function mentally without the presence and engagement of others.



Stage 3: Complete Mental Collapse (for the victim):

Victims begin to lose all sense of self, reality, and emotional regulation, leading to irreversible mental deterioration.

The infected person, deprived of their mental source, may begin to experience their own cognitive collapse, resorting to more desperate methods to maintain contact with others.

Treatment:

The only known treatments are:

1. Immediate Contact Severance:

Cutting all ties with the infected individual is the most effective way to halt the parasitic process.

Victims must relocate to a peaceful, isolated environment to allow their brains to recover from the neurochemical influence.



2. Extreme Relaxation Therapy:

High-dose anti-anxiety and mood-stabilizing medications to repair the damaged mental structure.

Prolonged sensory deprivation and exposure to soothing environments to aid in the brain’s healing process.





---

Prognosis:

If treated early by severing contact with the infected individual, most victims can recover, though emotional scars and residual paranoia may remain. The infected individual, however, cannot survive without continued parasitic relationships. If isolated, they may experience their own mental collapse as their ability to sustain cognitive function diminishes.

This version of Elanaitism emphasizes the parasitic relationship and the impact of neurochemical shifts, focusing on the infection's subtle, gradual progression.
